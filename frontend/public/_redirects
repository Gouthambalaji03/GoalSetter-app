    /api/* https://your-backend-host.example.com/api/:splat 200
    /* /index.html 200
    ```
  - Replace `your-backend-host.example.com` with your real backend URL.

- Redeploy:
  - Trigger a fresh deploy. If issues persist, “Clear cache and deploy site” in Netlify.

- If it still 404s:
  - Use netlify.toml (alternative to _redirects) at repo root:
    ```toml
    [build]
    base = "frontend"
    command = "npm run build"
    publish = "build"

    [[redirects]]
    from = "/api/*"
    to = "https://your-backend-host.example.com/api/:splat"
    status = 200
    force = true

    [[redirects]]
    from = "/*"
    to = "/index.html"
    status = 200
    ```
  - Redeploy after committing.

- Quick diagnostic:
  - Visiting a deep link like `/login` should load the app (served via `/* /index.html 200`).
  - In DevTools → Network, `/api/*` requests should hit your backend URL.
